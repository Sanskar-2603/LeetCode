# Problem: Diameter of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Examples
### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### Example 2
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

## Intuition
The problem asks to find the length of the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

## Approach
The given Java code implements a solution with the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `diameter` to store the maximum diameter.
2. Create a method `calDiameter` that calculates the depth of the tree at each node and updates the diameter accordingly.
3. Recursively traverse the tree using the `calDiameter` method.
4. At each node, calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees.
5. Update the diameter with the sum of left and right depths.
6. Return the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees plus 1.
7. The final result is stored in the `diameter` variable.

## Steps
1. Initialize a variable `diameter` to 0.
2. Create a method `calDiameter` that takes a `TreeNode` as input.
3. In the `calDiameter` method:
    a. Check if the node is null. If so, return 0.
    b. Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree using `calDiameter`.
    c. Recursively calculate the depth of the right subtree using `calDiameter`.
    d. Update the `diameter` variable with the sum of left and right depths.
    e. Return the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees plus 1.
4. Initialize the `diameter` variable to 0.
5. Call the `calDiameter` method with the root of the binary tree.
6. Return the final result stored in the `diameter` variable.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the space required for the call stack is proportional to the height of the tree.
